                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                                            <div class="about-story">
                            <p class="intro">I'm Zornitsa and I believe that movement is a path to inner stability, not just a means for physical change.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sports has always been part of my life ‚Äì from childhood years to today. Not as competition or escape, but as a language through which I connect with my emotions. I remember the first time running helped me organize confused thoughts. Or how an ordinary workout brought back the feeling that I'm "here and now."</p>
                            
                            <p>Working with people came just as naturally to me. As an HR professional, for years I communicated with people in transitions ‚Äì career, emotional, personal. I learned to hear beyond words, to read the fatigue behind smiles and the tension behind silence. I saw how many of us live disconnected ‚Äì from our bodies, from our needs, from ourselves.</p>
                            
                            <p>Gradually I understood that both my sides ‚Äì the one that trains and the one that listens ‚Äì can exist together. I'm not just an instructor who leads a workout. I'm there for people when their motivation crashes, when doubt drowns out the voice of the body.</p>
                            
                            <p>I help people return to movement ‚Äî not to chase ideals, but to regain their energy, emotional balance, and self-confidence.</p>
                            
                            <p>I believe that when we move with intention, we begin to think more clearly, feel more stable, and make better choices ‚Äî in nutrition, in lifestyle, in self-care.</p>
                            
                            <p>This is a natural cycle: movement supports emotional stability, which leads to better nutrition, and from there comes more energy and clarity. And most importantly ‚Äî we regain trust in ourselves.</p>
                            
                            <p>I combine knowledge from sports, coaching, and emotional intelligence to create a space where the body and inner world work together ‚Äî without pressure, without shame, at your own rhythm.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-quote">
                            <p>‚úÖ Movement doesn't start in the gym ‚Äî it starts with your mindset</p>
                            <p>‚úÖ When we move with purpose, we eat better, think clearer, and feel more stable</p>
                            <p>‚úÖ Real transformation doesn't start with calories and sets. It starts with connection</p>

                <p>Since 2020, I've been a certified Tabata and HIIT instructor, and since then, I've been leading groups where people don't just train ‚Äì they love sports, challenge themselves every day, and inspire me too to become even better.</p>

                <p>My groups consist of people with different levels of preparation but with a common passion ‚Äì the desire to grow, to exceed their limits, and to do it with a smile. In addition to dynamic group workouts, I also offer a personal approach ‚Äì one-on-one training, especially for beginners or those who want to start slowly and get acquainted with exercise.</p>

                <p>I combine workouts with coaching on nutrition and sustainable lifestyle because I believe that sport is more than physical activity ‚Äì it's a complete change in our way of life and thinking.</p>

                <p>This work brings me true satisfaction ‚Äì every workout is an opportunity to support people in their growth, to see how they overcome obstacles and feel stronger and more confident. For me, it's important not just to lead workouts, but to be part of their personal journey towards health and balance.</p>

                        <p>Intuitive eating is an approach that brings us back to ourselves. It's not a diet, it's not a list of forbidden foods, and it's not another regime that we'll abandon after a while. It's a way of eating based on respect for the body, on listening and awareness.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a world that constantly tells us what to eat and how to look, intuitive eating says: "Stop. Listen to yourself."</p>
                        
                        <p>Your body has wisdom. It sends signals ‚Äì for hunger, for fullness, for lack of energy, for overeating. But often these signals are drowned out by external rules and internal beliefs ‚Äì that you must always be in control, that you must "earn" your food, that if you're not perfect ‚Äì you're not enough.</p>
                        
                        <p>True transformation happens when we start eating from respect, not from guilt. Intuitive eating teaches us exactly this ‚Äì to reconnect with our needs and to believe that our body knows.</p>

                    <div class="article-text">
                        <p>In a world full of diets, eating regimens, and conflicting advice, building a healthy way of eating without falling into extremes seems like a real challenge. Many people believe that to be healthy and in good shape, they need to restrict themselves drastically or follow strict rules. However, the truth is that sustainable and beneficial eating habits are built precisely through balance, understanding, and respect for one's own body.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why don't extremes work?</h4>
                        <p>Diets with many restrictions, prohibitions, or self-violence often lead to temporary success but not long-term health. They can cause stress, guilt, and even physical imbalances. Extremes don't allow the body to adapt harmoniously and often lead to the "yo-yo" effect ‚Äì rapid weight regain after dieting.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How to build healthy eating habits?</h4>
                        
                        <h5>1. Start with small steps</h5>
                        <p>You don't need to change your entire eating regimen at once. Include more fruits and vegetables, gradually reduce sugar, drink more water. Small changes over time lead to big results.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. Listen to your body</h5>
                        <p>Instead of focusing on prohibitions, pay attention to what makes you feel good. Which foods give you energy and joy? How does your body react to different products?</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Don't deprive yourself</h5>
                        <p>Excluding entire food groups or strict restrictions can lead to deficiencies in important substances and increase cravings for "forbidden" foods. Allow yourself your favorite foods in moderate amounts, without guilt.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4. Balance and variety</h5>
                        <p>Aim for a diverse menu that includes all food groups ‚Äì carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. This ensures that the body receives everything it needs.</p>
                        
                        <h5>5. Pay attention to portions</h5>
                        <p>Portion control is important, but you don't need to count calories constantly. Learn to recognize the feeling of fullness and eat slowly and mindfully.</p>
                        
                        <h5>6. Take care of your emotional relationship with food</h5>
                        <p>Food is not just a physical necessity; it's often connected to emotions. Learn to distinguish hunger from emotional eating and find healthy ways to cope with your feelings.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Healthy eating habits are not about extremes, but about balance, respect for the body, and joy from eating. Allow yourself to be flexible, to listen to yourself, and to take care of your health in a sustainable way. This way, food will be a source of strength and pleasure, not stress and restrictions.</p>

                    <div class="article-text">
                        <p>We often hear that success in maintaining a healthy eating regimen depends solely on willpower. "Just say no to sweets," "you need to have discipline" ‚Äì these sound like universal recipes for controlling eating. But the truth is that food and emotions are deeply connected, and eating problems often don't boil down to just a lack of willpower.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why do emotions affect eating?</h4>
                        <p>Food is not just fuel for our bodies. It's also a way to take care of ourselves, to reward ourselves, to comfort ourselves, or even to express emotions. When we're happy, we might celebrate with a favorite dessert. When we're sad, many people seek comfort in food. When we're stressed, hunger can disappear or, conversely, intensify.</p>
                        
                        <p>This emotional component of eating means that many of our choices are subconscious and related to the need to regulate our mood. That's why sometimes our willpower proves powerless against the force of emotional habits.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What is emotional eating?</h4>
                        <p>Emotional eating is a process where we use food as a means of coping with emotions, rather than satisfying a physical need for energy. This can manifest through overeating during stress, sadness, or boredom, or conversely ‚Äì through refusing food during anxiety.</p>
                        
                        <p>Often this pattern leads to a vicious cycle ‚Äì a person feels bad, eats emotionally, then feels guilty, which again triggers the need for comfort through food.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why isn't willpower enough?</h4>
                        <p>Willpower is needed, but it alone doesn't solve the problem if we don't understand what lies behind our emotional reactions to food. Fighting only the symptoms (for example, "don't eat sweets") without examining the emotional triggers is like trying to stop a leak with your fingers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How to cope?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Learn to recognize when you're eating due to emotions, not hunger. Keep a journal where you note how you feel before and after eating.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alternative ways to manage emotions:</strong> Instead of turning to food, find other strategies ‚Äì walking, meditation, talking to a friend.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance, not fighting:</strong> Don't blame yourself if you sometimes eat emotionally. This is part of human behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional support:</strong> If emotional eating seriously affects your life, consult with a psychologist or nutritionist who works holistically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Food and emotions are connected more deeply than we think. Control over eating is not just a matter of willpower, but of understanding and managing our own feelings. When we learn to listen to our body and emotions, we can build a healthier and more sustainable relationship with food.</p>

                    <div class="article-text">
                        <p>In an era where calories are everywhere ‚Äì in nutrition apps, on product labels, in diet plans ‚Äì we can easily get lost in the numbers and forget the essence of what we're actually eating. But wholesome food is not just a sum of calories. It's much more ‚Äì a source of health, energy, and joy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What does wholesome food mean?</h4>
                        <p>Wholesome food is that which provides the body not only with energy but also with all the necessary nutrients for its proper functioning. These are vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fiber, healthy fats, and proteins ‚Äì components that support the health of cells, the immune system, the brain, and the entire body.</p>
                        
                        <p>It includes whole, minimally processed foods ‚Äì fresh vegetables and fruits, nuts, seeds, whole grains, quality protein sources, and healthy fats. Such food nourishes both the body and the mind.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why isn't wholesome food measured only in calories?</h4>
                        <p>Calories show the amount of energy we get from food, but they say nothing about the quality of that energy. For example, 100 calories from sugar are completely different in their effect on the body from 100 calories that come from nuts or vegetables.</p>
                        
                        <p>Calories also don't reflect how food affects our hormones, metabolism, digestion, and mood. Therefore, focusing only on calorie intake can lead to deficiencies in important nutrients and create stress around eating.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How to orient ourselves towards wholesome food?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Choose whole foods:</strong> The less processed the products, the more wholesome they are.</li>
                            <li><strong>Color and variety:</strong> Colorful fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants and various vitamins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> It knows what it needs. Don't forget to eat with attention and awareness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance and moderation:</strong> Wholesome food doesn't exclude pleasure ‚Äì allow yourself your favorite flavors without unnecessary stress.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Wholesome food is caring for yourself and your body ‚Äì it's quality, diverse, and balanced. Calories are just a number, but the true value of food is measured in how we feel and function thanks to it. Therefore, let eating be a source of health and joy, not restrictions and calculations.</p>

                        <p>"I love Tabata because it gives me energy and makes me feel fit. I love movement - it energizes me, clears my mind, and helps me take care of myself. I'm motivated by the feeling that I'm becoming healthier, more resilient, and more confident with every workout. I keep going because this is a proven investment in my health and well-being. The workouts are my time for myself ‚Äì time when I strengthen my body and find balance in my mind. My motivation is also supported by a young and smiling girl - a wonderful Tabata instructor - Zori. And that makes a huge difference!"</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="article-text">
                        <p>High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is a simple idea: you alternate short bursts of challenging effort with easy recovery. Push a bit harder, then catch your breath. Repeat. You can do it with walking, cycling, swimming, a skipping rope, or bodyweight moves‚Äîno special equipment or long sessions required.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Why is HIIT so popular?</h4>
                        <p>Because it respects your time. Those brief "work" intervals ask more from your heart, lungs, and muscles than steady, gentle exercise, so your body adapts quickly. Over a few weeks, everyday tasks feel easier, stairs don't steal your breath, and your general energy rises. You're training your system to deliver oxygen and fuel more efficiently, all in sessions that fit between meetings or after a busy day.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The health payoffs go well beyond fitness</h4>
                        <p>Regular HIIT helps your heart by improving how efficiently it pumps and how well your blood vessels relax. It supports healthy blood pressure and blood sugar control, which is good news for long-term heart and metabolic health. Many people also notice clearer headspace, less stress, and better sleep on days they move‚Äîbenefits that make it easier to stick with exercise.</p>
                        
                        <h4>HIIT is flexible and beginner-friendly</h4>
                        <p>The "high intensity" is relative to you: a fast walk up a hill can be a perfectly valid interval if running isn't your thing. You control how hard the work phases feel, how long they last, and how much recovery you take. That makes HIIT accessible for different fitness levels, ages, and body types, and easy to adapt around busy schedules or travel.</p>
                        
                        <p>It's also motivating. Because work and rest alternate, the tough parts are over quickly, and there's always a breather coming. That rhythm helps you stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed. And because sessions are short, you're more likely to be consistent‚Äîarguably the most important "secret" behind any fitness success.</p>
                        
                        <h4>A quick note on "Tabata"</h4>
                        <p>You've probably heard of the 20-seconds-on, 10-seconds-off format. That's just one style of HIIT, not a rule you have to follow. The core idea is simply intervals of effort and recovery. Choose movements you enjoy, and scale the challenge to your current level.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Safety matters, too</h4>
                        <p>HIIT should feel "hard but controlled," not reckless. If you live with a medical condition, are pregnant or postpartum, or haven't exercised in a long time, start gently and talk to a health professional if you're unsure. Mild breathlessness is normal; sharp pain, chest discomfort, or dizziness are signs to stop.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Bottom line</h4>
                        <p>HIIT gives you big benefits in small pockets of time. It strengthens your heart and lungs, boosts everyday energy, supports healthy blood pressure and blood sugar, and can lift your mood‚Äîall without living at the gym. Keep it simple, choose activities you enjoy, and let the intervals do the work. Consistency beats perfection.</p>
